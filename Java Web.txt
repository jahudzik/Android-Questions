What is HTTP?
- HyperText Transfer Protocol
- An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.
- Functions as a request-response protocol in the client-server computing model
- HTTP is an application layer protocol, but its definition presumes an underlying transport layer protocol, which are commonly reliable TCP or unreliable UDP protocols.
- It is stateless protocol because each command is executed independently

What is HTTP session?
- A sequence of network request-response transactions.
- An HTTP client initiates a request by establishing a TCP connection to a particular port on a server (typically port 80, occasionally port 8080).
- An HTTP server listening on that port waits for a client's request message.
- Upon receiving the request, the server sends back a status line, such as "HTTP/1.1 200 OK", and a message of its own.

What are HTTP request methods?
1 GET
2 POST
3 HEAD
4 PUT
5 DELETE
6 TRACE
7 OPTIONS
8 CONNECT
9 PATCH

Which request methods HTTP servers are required to implement at least?
- GET and HEAD
- Whenever possible, also OPTIONS

What is HTTPS?
- A communications protocol for secure communication over a computer network, with especially wide deployment on the Internet.
- Technically, it is not a protocol; rather, it is the result of simply layering the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) on top of the SSL or TLS protocol, thus adding the security capabilities of SSL/TLS to standard HTTP communications.
- It provides authentication and bidirectional encryption of communications between a client and server

What are differences between HTTP and HTTPS?
1 URL beginning: http:// vs https://
2 HTTP uses port 80 to communicate, while HTTPS uses 433
3 HTTP operates at application layer, HTTPS at transport layer
4 HTTPS is encrypted and requires certificate, HTTP not

What is a Servlet? 
- A Java class used to process client requests and generate dynamic web content.
- Servlets are mostly used to process or store data submitted by an HTML form, provide dynamic content and manage state information that does not exist in the stateless HTTP protocol.

Explain the architechure of a Servlet. 
- The core abstraction that must be implemented by all servlets is the javax.servlet.Servlet interface. Each servlet must implement it either directly or indirectly, either by extending javax.servlet.GenericServlet or javax.servlet.http.HTTPServlet. 
- Finally, each servlet is able to serve multiple requests in parallel using multithreading.

What is the difference between an Applet and a Servlet? 
- An Applet is a client side Java program that runs within a Web browser on the client machine.
- A servlet is a server side component that runs on the web server.
- An applet can use the user interface classes, while a servlet does not have a user interface. Instead, a servlet waits for client’s HTTP requests and generates a response in every request.

Explain the life cycle of a Servlet. 
- On every client’s request, the Servlet Engine loads the servlets and invokes its init() methods. 
- Then, the Servlet object handles all subsequent requests coming from that client, by invoking the service method for each request separately.
- Finally, the servlet is removed by calling the server’s destroy() method.

Describe the GET method.
- It appends the name-value pairs on the request’s URL.
- Thus, there is a limit on the number of characters and subsequently on the number of values that can be used in a client’s request.
- Furthermore, the values of the request are made visible and thus, sensitive information must not be passed in that way.

Describe the POST method.
- It overcomes the limit imposed by the GET request, by sending the values of the request inside its body.
- Also, there is no limitations on the number of values to be sent across.
- Finally, the sensitive information passed through a POST request is not visible to an external client.

What are the types of web applications?
- presentation-oriented
- service-oriented

What is presentation-oriented web application?
It generates interactive web pages containing various types of markup language (HTML, XHTML, XML, and so on) and dynamic content in response to requests. 

What is service-oriented web application?
- It implements the endpoint of a web service.
- Presentation-oriented applications are often clients of service-oriented web applications. 

What is Servlet Chaining? 
- Method where the output of one servlet is sent to a second servlet. The output of the second servlet can be sent to a third servlet, and so on.
- The last servlet in the chain is responsible for sending the response to the client.

How do you find out what client machine is making a request to your servlet?
The ServletRequest class has methods:
- getRemoteAddr() gets the IP address of the client machine 
- getRemoteHost() gets the host name of the client machine

What is the structure of the HTTP response? 
The HTTP response consists of three parts:
1 Status Code
2 HTTP Headers
3 Body

What is HTTP response status code?
- It describes the status of the response.
- In case the request failed, the status code can be used to find out the reason behind the failure.
- If servlet does not return a status code, the success status code, HttpServletResponse.SC_OK, is returned by default.

What are HTTP response headers?
- They contain more information about the response.
- For example, the headers may specify the date/time after which the response is considered stale, or the form of encoding used to safely transfer the entity to the user.

What is HTTP response body?
- It contains the content of the response.
- The body may contain HTML code, an image, etc.
- The body consists of the data bytes transmitted in an HTTP transaction message immediately following the headers.

What is a cookie? 
- A bit of information that the Web server sends to the browser.
- The browser stores the cookies for each Web server in a local file.
- In a future request, the browser, along with the request, sends all stored cookies for that specific Web server.

What is the difference between session and cookie ?
- The session should work, regardless of the settings on the client browser. The client may have chosen to disable cookies.
- The HTTP session is capable of storing any Java object, while a cookie can only store String objects.

Which protocol will be used by browser and servlet to communicate? 
HTTP protocol

What is HTTP Tunneling? 
- Technique by which, communications performed using various network protocols are encapsulated using the HTTP or HTTPS protocols.
- The HTTP protocol therefore acts as a wrapper for a channel that the network protocol being tunneled uses to communicate. 

What is URL Encoding and URL Decoding? 
- The URL encoding procedure is responsible for replacing all the spaces and every other extra special character of a URL, into their corresponding Hex representation.
- URL decoding is the exact opposite procedure.

What is a JSP?
- JavaServer Pages
- Technology that mixes static content with dynamically-generated content.
- JSP is a text document that contains two types of text: static data and JSP elements. 
- Static data can be expressed in any text-based format, such as HTML or XML. 

How are the JSP requests handled?
1 On the arrival of a JSP request, the browser first requests a page with a .jsp extension. 
2 The Web server reads the request and using the JSP compiler, the Web server converts the JSP page into a servlet class. 
3 The generated servlet class is invoked, in order to handle the browser’s request.
4 Once the execution of the request is over, the servlet sends a response back to the client.

What are the advantages of JSP?
1 can be pre-compiled.
2 can be easily combined to static templates, including HTML or XML fragments, with code that generates dynamic content.
3 are dynamically compiled into servlets and thus, the developers can easily make updates to presentation code.
