What's difference between Serializable and Parcelable?
- Serializable is much simpler to use (it's marker interface), but slower due to reflection and many temporary objects created.
- Parcelable requires several methods to be implemented (describeContents(), writeToParcel(), CREATOR static field) but is about 10 times faster.

How implementation of Parcelable interface should look like?
Class implementing this interface must implement two methods:
- writeToParcel() - all class fields should be written to the Parcel
- describeContents() - returns some int (API suggests 0)
Additionally static field called CREATOR must be added. It must be of Parcelable.Creator<> type, which requires implementing two more methods:
- createFromParcel() - reads from the Parcel and returns object instance
- newArray() - returns new array of objects

What are the options to handle configuration changes?
1. Don't do anything - Android retains automatically for example EditText content

4. Handle chosen configuration changes yourself by specifying them in the manifest and implementing onConfigurationChanged() in Activity
