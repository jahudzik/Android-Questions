Name main types of components in Android.
1 Activities
2 Services
3 Content Providers
4 Broadcast Receivers
5 Intents
6 Notifications

What frameworks are used to render Android UI?
Most activities use "the widget framework" for rendering their user interface, though you are welcome to use the 2D (Canvas) and 3D (OpenGL) APIs as well for more specialized GUIs.

What is Service?
An application component that can perform long-running operations in the background and does not provide a user interface. 

What is Content Provider?
It provides a level of abstraction for any data stored on the device that is accessible by multiple applications.

What is Broadcast Receiver?
It can arrange to listen for broadcasts from system or other applications and respond accordingly.

What is Intent?
It encapsulates a request, made to Android, for some activity or other receiver to do something.

How developer's code gets transformed and run as an Android application?
1. Developers write Java-syntax source code using Android and 3rd party libraries 
2. Developers compile the source code into Java VM bytecode, using standard javac compiler
3. Developers translate the Java VM bytecode into Dalvik VM bytecode, which is packaged with other files into a ZIP archive with the .apk extension (the APK file).
4. An Android device or emulator runs the APK file, causing the bytecode to be executed by an instance of a Dalvik VM.

Which Java versions are supported by Android?
- Java 6 and 7
- OpenJDK

What is AndroidManifest.xml?
XML file describing the application being built and what components — activities, services, etc. — are being supplied by that application.

What is hold in Android project's bin directory?
Application files (.class, .dex, .apk) as they are compiled.

What is hold in Android project's res directory?
All resources, such as icons, GUI layouts, and the like, that get packaged with the compiled Java in the application.

What is hold in Android project's src directory?
Java source code for the application.

What is hold in Android project's assets directory?
Static files (non-resources) to be packaged with the application for deployment onto the device

What is hold in Android project's gen directory?
Source code generated by Android build tools.

What is .apk file and what it contains?
It is a ZIP archive containing:
1 the .dex file, 
2 the compiled edition of your resources (resources.arsc), 
3 any un-compiled resources (such as what you put in res/raw/) 
4 the AndroidManifest.xml file

What is aapt tool?
- Android Asset Packaging Tool - it generates an R.java source file within your project’s gen/ directory
- It allows you to access layouts and widgets within those layouts directly from your Java code

What are typical heap size limits on Android devices?
It may be as low as 16MB, though values in the 32–48MB range are more typical with current-generation devices.

What is library project?
- It is designed to share code and resources between Android application projects.
- It distributes resources as well as Java code - that differs it from JAR file

What is Android Support package?
Classes (in JARs and an Android library project) distributed by Google that are not part of the Android SDK, but are available to Android developers.
Two major areas:
1 backports - of capabilities added to newer versions of Android
2 new features - that are not going to be in the Android SDK but that Google wishes to make available for Android developers

When VerifyError is thrown?
When the VM notices that an attempt is made to load a class which does not pass the class verification phase.

What actions must be made to add a new Activity?
1 define layout in XML file (can be skipped and defined from code) 
2 implement class extending Activity
3 add <Activity> entry to AndroidManifest.xml

How to start an another Activity?
A. startActivity(new Intent(this, OtherActivity.class))
B. startActivityForResult(new Intent(this, OtherActivity.class))

How to pass extra attributes to starting Activity?
Intent.putExtra() method

What are possible Activity states?
1 Active - started by user, running and in the foreground
2 Paused - started by user, running, visible, but another activity is overlaying part of the screen unresponsive 
3 Stopped - started by user, running, but hidden by other activities
4 Dead - destroyed

When Activity gets killed?
A User presses the BACK button
B finish() is called from activity 
C Device goes through a configuration change
D Unhandled exception is thrown
E When it’s in the background and Android chooses to destroy it to free up RAM

What happens with Activity on configuration change by default?
- Activity is destroyed - onPause(), onStop() and onDestroy()
- new instance of the same activity class is created, using the same Intent that was used to create the original instance - onCreate(), onStart() and onResume() 

What are the options of handling configuration changes?
- setRetainInstance(true) - fragments
- onSaveInstanceState() - activities/fragments
- onRetainNonConfigurationInstance() - activities [depreciated]
- android:configChanges in manifest - activites [not recommended]

Why Google doesn't recommend using android:configChanges in manifest to handle configuration changes?
1 We are not handling all possible configuration changes.
2 We might forget some resource that needs to be changed

How to block orientation change?
- Specify <application> or <activity> android:screenOrientation value in manifest
- Android still treats this as a configuration change, despite the fact that there is no visible change to the user

What happens in the main application thread?
- processes main event queue
- executes nearly all Activity’s callback (onCreate, onClick etc)
- the only thread allowed to do UI changes (UI operations are not thread-safe)

What operations should be done in background thread?
- internet access
- significant file operations
- database operations
- complex calculations

When ANR dialog is shown?
1 when UI reaction takes more than 5 seconds
2 when Broadcast Receiver takes more than 10 seconds to execute

Is it possible to perform any UI operation outside the main thread?
- No, UI operations are not thread-safe. 
- CalledFromWrongThreadException will be thrown.

What happens if user violates some permission?
SecurityException is thrown

What are available file types?
1 raw resources
2 XML resources
3 assets

What's difference between raw resources and assets?
Resources are accessed by id (R.raw.abc), assets by name and location.

What's difference in saving data internally and externally?
- Files you write to in your own internal storage cannot be read or written to by other applications - unless somebody has rooted device.
- Files on external storage are visible to all applications.

What filesystems are used on Android?
- YAFFS [Android 1.x & 2.x] - problem: only one process can write to the filesystem at a time
- ext4 [Android 3.0+]

What is Otto?
Event bus by Square designed for Android.

How to use Otto?
- Create singleton Bus object.
- To subscribe for events
a) register class: bus.register(this);
b) annotate any method with @Subscribe. It should have one parameter of expected type.
- Call bus.post(...) method passing any object to post it to subscribers.

What's difference between Preferences and SharedPreferences?
- Preferences - activity-specific (private) 
- SharedPreferences - application-level 

How to open HTTP connection and read from there?
- HttpURLConnection c=(HttpURLConnection)url.openConnection();
- reader=new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(c.getInputStream()))

What class should be used to proceed with long-running HTTP downloads (working in the background, reconnecting etc)?
DownloadManager

What is OkHttp?
1 clone of the standard HttpUrlConnection to offer many performance improvements
2 support for SPDY
3 wraps up common HTTP performance-improvement patterns, such as GZIP compression, response caching, and connection pooling

What is Retrofit?
- Type-safe REST client for Android and Java by Square
- It handles the data parsing and marshaling, along with the HTTP operations and (optionally) background threading.

What is Picasso?
Library designed by Square to help with asynchronously loading images.

What is Volley?
Can be thought of as a superset of Retrofit plus Picasso, minus Picasso’s non-HTTP image loading facilities.

What are two types of intents?
1 explicit - component to be started specified by name
2 implicit - declare a general action to perform, system finds the appropriate component

How to make the application receive specific intents?
Declare <intent-filter> in the manifest.
