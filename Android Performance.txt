Why using question mark parameter markers such as 'phone=?' instead of explicit values in queries, ex passed to ContentResolver.query() is better for performance?
Queries that differ only by those values will be recognized as the same for caching purposes.

What are the ways of improving layout performance?
1 Don't block UI thread with heavy operations
2 Analyse layout with Hierarchy Viewer
3 Analyse layout with lint
4 Reuse layout with <include>
5 Simplify hierarchy with <merge>
6 Load views on demand with ViewStub
7 Use ViewHolder pattern for ListViews

Describe ViewHolder pattern.
Implementation pattern increasing ListView for approx 15%.
1 Define ListView's inner static view holder class with row's views.
2 In Adapter.getView() method, for each newly created and inflated row's layout view, set tag with view holder object holding references to row's views.
3 When reusing row views, instead of calling findViewById() for each rows element, use references from its view holder.

Name some lint suggestions to improve layout performance?
1 Replace TextView+ImageView with compound drawable
2 Replace <FrameLayout> with <merge> if it's in layout root and doesn't specify background, padding etc
3 Remove useless leaf - layout with no children or no background
4 Remove useless parent - non-ScroolView layout with only one child 
5 Too much nesting (above 10 levels) in hierarchy

What slows down layout performance?
1 UI thread overloaded with heavy operations
2 nested layouts - multiple measure-layout-draw operations
3 use of layout_weight in LinearLayout

What is default maximum depth for view hierarchy (guarded by lint)?
10
