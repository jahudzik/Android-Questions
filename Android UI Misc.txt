What is the primary usage of drag/drop framework?
Data movement from one view to another view in the current layout.

Describe drag/drop process.
1 Each View can register its View.OnDragListener
2 User begins to drag -> application calls startDrag()
3 System sends a ACTION_DRAG_STARTED drag event to the drag event listeners for all the View objects in the current layout.
4 To continue to receive drag events, a drag event listener must return true.
5 User continues the drag -> as the drag shadow intersects a View, the system sends drag events to the View object's drag event listener 
6 User releases the drag -> system sends the View object's listener a ACTION_DROP drag event
7 System sends out a ACTION_DRAG_ENDED drag event to indicate that the drag operation is over.
